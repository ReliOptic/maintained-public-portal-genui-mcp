# Two-stage filter-then-score ranking

The architecture v0.1 document §4 expressed ranking as `Q = S_entry × W_context` over all eight features. We replace that with a four-stage pipeline:

1. **Safety / quality gate** drops the candidate if `confidence_score < 0.85`, status is not `published`, `merged_into != null`, or `menu_path` is missing.
2. **Positive-feature score** computes `Q = Σ_i S_entry[i] × W_context[i]` over the **seven positive** features (IF, PF, LF, SE, UR, AC, EV). `sensitivity_risk` is **excluded** from the score.
3. **SR-driven presentation adjustment** caps `ui_slot` at `secondary_card` when `SR ≥ 0.85` and forces `safe_copy_rule = "confirm_not_assert"`.
4. **Top-K cut and slot assignment.**

`sensitivity_risk` and `confidence_score` are **gates and presentation modifiers, never score terms**.

## Considered options

- **Pure dot product (§4 literal).** Rejected: under a literal `Q = S × W`, a high `sensitivity_risk` raises the score (because weights are positive), which is the opposite of the safety intent. Also collapses "why not shown?" and "why this order?" into one number.
- **`Q = Σ positive_sum − λ · SR`.** Rejected: blurs the safety boundary with the relevance score, making [[explain_ranking]] ambiguous ("low score because of safety or because of fit?").
- **Learning-to-rank ML model.** Rejected for v0.1 — no logged user interactions exist yet.

## Consequences

- `explain_ranking` (deferred past v0.1) can answer "why not shown?" and "why this order?" from disjoint mechanisms — the gate result and the weighted-sum trace.
- The Stage 1 gate is hard-coded thresholds; tuning them is a `weights_version` patch (not a Catalog change), kept separate from any per-Entry data change.
- `compose_genui_artifact` can trust `ui_slot` and `safe_copy_rule` on every result item — they are already post-Stage-3.

## Amendment (API-first session)

The four-stage pipeline shape stays. What changed is **where the weight vector `W_context` comes from**: [[ADR-0006]] makes the host LLM's per-query `weight_override` the primary source, with compositional `W_base + Σ Δ_axis` as fallback. The pipeline still:

1. Drops candidates by gate.
2. Computes `Q = Σ_i S_i · W_i` over the positive features.
3. Applies SR-driven `ui_slot` / `safe_copy_rule` adjustments.
4. Cuts Top-K.

`sensitivity_risk` remains a Stage-1 / Stage-3 gate, not a score term — the host LLM cannot weight-engineer around it.

The positive-feature count grows from 7 to **9**: the Feature Dictionary expanded to 11 in [[ADR-0002]]'s amendment, but two features stay out of the score. `sensitivity_risk` is excluded as a safety gate (Stage 1 / Stage 3 only). `official_handoff_need` is also excluded — it is handled by `access_mode`-driven CTA and handoff presentation policy, not by the primary ranking score. This avoids a zero-sum conflict with `api_availability` and keeps ranking focused on user relevance, urgency, actionability, evidence, and freshness. Resulting positive set: `IF, PF, LF, SE, UR, AC, EV, api_availability, freshness`.

## Subsequent amendments

- [[ADR-0015]] — Adds `insight_card` as a fourth `ui_slot` value. `portal: "data_go_kr"` Entries with intent overlapping `{data_search, dataset_download, api_application, policy_information}` are classified as [[Insight Entry]] and assigned `insight_card` at Stage 4. They participate in the same five-stage pipeline without modification; the slot value governs composer rendering only.
- [[ADR-0010]] — Inserts a context-keyed **Stage 0** before the safety gate. The pipeline becomes five-stage: `context-filter → safety-gate → score → SR-shape → cut`. Stage 0 bounds the candidate set by `persona / intent / life_event` set-overlap and enforces strict `region` exclusion before scoring.
- [[ADR-0014]] — Wraps the pipeline output with an in-process LRU rank cache, keyed exactly as CONTEXT.md `catalog_version` documents. Invalidation is by process restart only.
